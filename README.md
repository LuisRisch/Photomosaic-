# Photomosaic-

This is a school work. The objective is to build a mosaic using a ppm(P6 and P3) image as input. The algorithm wont work if the input image isnt the ppm type. 
To compile, just write "make" in the the terminal in the root of the project. 

Write ./mosaico -h after compiling to see the usage.
